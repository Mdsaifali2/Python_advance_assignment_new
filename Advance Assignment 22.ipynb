However, they have significant differences in terms of functionality, performance, and the scope of their capabilities. Here are the main differences between the array module and numpy:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Types:\n",
    "    -> array : The array module provides a basic data type for storing arrays of a single data type. It supports numeric types like integers and floats, but it is limited in the types of operations you can perform on these arrays.\n",
    "    -> numpy : NumPy, on the other hand, offers a much wider range of data types, including complex numbers, higher-precision floating-point types, and more. It also supports more advanced data types like records and structured arrays.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Functionality :\n",
    "    -> array: The array module offers a limited set of operations and methods for manipulating arrays. It doesn't have the extensive range of mathematical and array operations that NumPy provides.\n",
    "    -> numpy: NumPy is a powerful library that offers a wide range of functions and operations for working with arrays. It includes mathematical functions, linear algebra operations, statistical functions, and more.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Performance :\n",
    "    -> array: While array can be more memory-efficient than Python lists, it doesn't offer the same level of performance optimizations as NumPy.\n",
    "    -> numpy: NumPy is highly optimized for numerical computations and can often perform operations much faster than standard Python code using lists or arrays."
