    "    Numpy array: This is in the form of matrix structure which have rows and columns. It generally performs python mathematical operation which is not genrally easy manually to perfomr in coding case. It may be of any dimensions like 1-d, 2-d, 3-d, 4-d, etc depend upon the use to requirement. Unlike dataframe, numpy array are  not in a tabular form which ahve records and have fields instead it is in the form of matrices. It can have single row and single column as well but dataframe poses more than one column\n",

Unlike numpy array which can have more single as well as many number of columns, but dataframe have more than one column. Dataframe can have any number of dimensons but it should be more than one. We can use numpy array operation in dataframe and can also convert the numpy array into dataframe.\n",
